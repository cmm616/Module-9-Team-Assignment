Module 9 Team Project

Download and analyze the file included in this Module called some_ python_program.py.

0) Create a github repo, add the program and a readme to your repo.

1) Run the program and observe what it does.

2) As a team, take a look at the code, try to take out or comment out lines to see how the program behaves. Observe if the Graphical User Interface (GUI) has changed in any way or if the behavior of the program is different. As a team, analyze the code and identify what lines or sections of the code do.

3) Document the code in the program where indicated with '#Document what the lines of code do here' in as much detail as possible. This should be a collaborative activity where the documentation goes back and forth on the main file that is in Github. Your commits should reflect a back and forth process. 

4) Once the program has been documented you are finished. Note, some areas have been documented for you for clarity purposes.
